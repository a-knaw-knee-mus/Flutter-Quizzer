1. ~~Save preferences for the desired color theme~~
1. When the user sets a sort type (for quiz and question seperately) it should be saved in Hive under the preferences box
1. Set a placeholder for when there are no quizzes/questions
1. Star certain quizzes to show them at the top of the list
1. Star certain terms in a quiz and there should be an option in the sort type to only show the favorited terms
	- Star button will be a slidable action alongside edit/delete
	- Will be a secondary option alongside the sort type so can show the starred terms in alphabetical for example
	- When this sort option is selected can either:
		1) Only show the starred terms
		2) Show the starred terms first followed by a divider and the non-starred terms
			- A little harder but could create 2 listviews, each filtering for the starred/nonstarred terms like I did for the questionKeys var
1. ~~Saved preferences for the desired side of the card (currently left)~~
1. New page for expanding the carousel to its own focused page (like quizlet)
1. Import/Export
	- Export the app data as a file to share to other devices
	- Read an import file (of format that was exported above) to initalize the app on a new device
1. Add a reset button in settings that resets all app data (Hive boxes)
	- Should ask you to confirm by typing a word in a textbox like 'I agree'
